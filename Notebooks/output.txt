 Plan for and with respect to Lottie, while in Spain now until the 2nd of August. Give her space, no communication unless requested. Continue to go fast, write lots, learn about myself and become stronger. Be grateful for pain and grief. You learn that you are stronger than you credit yourself with. You are learning and reminding yourself that you can live a strong purposeful and fulfilled life alone. You have lost nothing. You could not afford to lose. Write your book, write your essays, write papers. Be not only incredible but also credible. Returning to London. Put through her letterbox something to the effect of I'm back and would like to see you and wish you a well. You do not have to come but I'll be there at time and place unless told otherwise. I hope that you have been well and have nothing but good wishes. Feel free to dress it up. Possible outcomes. She says she has no interest in being a part of my life. We're part ways and continue with Lin life knowing that you did your best and your duty to yourself. Two, she has had enough time and space to be ready to slowly ease back into a relationship. Discuss how we wish to proceed. Propose that we start dating, courting again as we are new and different people. Or three, she is wanting to go far with me but is not ready and needs more time alone. Here, reaffirm the position. Make your stance known and understood. You love her. You want to have a family and make a life with her. Until told that such dream is folly. Continue to go separate ways until the time is right. Personally I feel that three C is the most likely but I will not attack myself to anything. You come first Rob and you are loved. Analysis of thoughts. Let us see them for what we are. Reflecting on the Steve Jobs thing. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. I see in my mind that there are times in which I would like to go fast when my thoughts are fibril and creativity at critical mass. These are the times in which I want little else but to accelerate and be excellent. Such are these times now. I have been painfully subjective, decoupled not only from my best friend but much of my life in London. If you want to keep contact with me and fewer still could be considered confidence. This is good. You are free. You are unleashed. You can be dangerous and you can be brave. You can be bold. Now is the time to reforge yourself. You are molten, energetic, malleable and dangerous. Your ambition is the only limit to what you can do now. What do you want? Praise for this realization? No. You do not have time nor need to seek validation. Let your ambition and wisdom guide you as you reforge yourself to be new, stronger, more beautiful and more human in the crucible that is this city. You love the rhetoric of being broken so much. Good. Be broken and be remade. Our time is now. Our time is finite and our ambition infinite. Do not waste it. As for Lottie, a few pages ago you accepted that the best thing to do was to do nothing until we are back in London. Good. You are free, unleashed and unaccountable to nearly everyone. What you do now may yet define you, your new incarnation. Yearn and strive to be better. Good luck. I have faith in you and continue to be excellent.
